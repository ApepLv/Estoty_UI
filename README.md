I've implemented DOTWeen code to create a feature where the chest shakes upon pressing the spacebar in the main scene. This functionality will be integral to the game, triggering the chest to shake whenever a player clicks on it.

Additionally, I've introduced a Particle system, incorporating smoke particles and shiny balls, to enhance the visual appeal of the scene.

To improve user navigation, I've included a button in the top left corner that allows players to switch between scenes with ease.

Furthermore, to prevent the game from appearing static, I've added animations to the chest, causing it to hover instead of remaining as a static image. These adjustments aim to maintain the intended game design while enhancing its overall experience.
